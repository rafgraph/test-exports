# Test Exported Functions
[Live test](http://test-exported-functions.rafrex.com)

A simple test to check when exported functions are evaluated.

A function that is invoked on export is evaluated only once when imported. The very same function that is exported as a function, is invoked each time it is called in the imported file. This makes logical sense.
